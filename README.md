## Hangman is a classic word game in which you must find the correct answer by guessing letters one at a time. But be careful! You have a limited number of attempts, and every wrong letter brings you closer to failure.

### Thinking through the logic of this game was not easy, but extremely interesting!

### Used technologies: 

- SCSS/SASS
- JavaScript
- Eslint
- Webpack
- Web Storage API
